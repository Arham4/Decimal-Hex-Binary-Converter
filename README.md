# Decimal-Hex-Binary-Converter
This was a project for my previous school [Harmony School of Business](http://hsbdallas.org/). The main purpose of this project was to 
allow a quick, lightweight, offline tool on your phone to be used to convert decimal numbers to hexadecimal and binary numbers without 
the hassle, allowing for an accurate, speedy conversion if somebody were to be out in the field needing a quick conversion for a router 
(or switch, or any end device).
